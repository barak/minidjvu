This is the `base' of minidjvu. All algorithms depend on the base.

The base units may depend on each other in the order suggested by the numbers.
So, `0porting' does not depend on anything and `5image' may depend on all.

Here is the description of units:

    0porting - portability stuff (several typedefs)
    1error   - error handling
    2io      - stdio wrapper (we can have many `stdio's on Windows)
    3graymap - small number of 2D-arrays handling routines
    4bitmap  - the bitmap class (useful in a bitmap-processing library, right?)
    5image   - the "split" image class (that's what minidjvu is all about)
    6string  - just one routine that should probably go elsewhere
