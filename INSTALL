USUAL AUTOTOOLS-BASED INSTALLATION
__________________

Check that development package of libtiff is installed.
Run:
 autoreconf --install
 ./configure
 make
 make install
Will install minidjvu executable into /usr/local/bin/, as well as
various support files, documentation, development files, etc.



BLOODSHED DEV-C++
_________________

In case if you want to compile it for Windows, there's a project
file for Bloodshed Dev-C++. You will also need Libtiff for Windows,
which may be found here:
    http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/tiff.htm



CUSTOM COMPILATION
__________________

If you want to compile it all manually, read this.

The release directory should be treated as an include directory
(usually -I or /I option). That applies both to the library and the program.

The library is built from sources in `minidjvu' subdirectory.
The program is built from sources in `src' subdirectory.

To enable TIFF support, define HAVE_LIBTIFF to 1, add libtiff include directory
to the include path, then link against libtiff.



OTHERWISE
_________

Under Linux, you can always try something like

    g++ -Iinclude `find -name "*.c*"` -O2 -o minidjvu
    
or, if you want TIFF support,

    g++ -DHAVE_LIBTIFF=1 -Iinclude `find -name "*.c*"` -O2 -ltiff -o minidjvu

Under MSVC, watch for those __declspec directives in
`minidjvu/base/0porting/0porting.h' - if you wish a DLL, turn them on.



COMPILING ON MAC
________________

That instruction was useful when there were configure scripts (are they
really useful if they can't handle the Mac stuff?).

/* This instructions were kindly sent to me by Alejandro David Weil.
 * Apparently, there are some problems with Macs, but I don't know why.
 */

After some tries I got minidjvu built and running on mac os X panther.
I had to make this:

1. setup:
export MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=10.3

2. run configure in this way:
LDFLAGS="-L/sw/lib" ./configure

3.before compile, modify file libtool changing the allow_undefined_flag to:
allow_undefined_flag="-undefined dynamic_lookup"

4. now run:
make 



PORTING
_______

Browse through `minidjvu/base/0porting.h' to see if it needs changing.
What next, I don't know :)
